Coursework Activity
======================================================================
Copyright University of London.

Any queries, please email coursework@london.ac.uk

The Coursework Activity has been written to provide a way to receive coursework and have it marked without teachers knowing which student the work belongs to. Multiple markers are also supported where a final grade can be agreed based on several options. It does not replace the standard assignment activity and is intended to work alongside it.
